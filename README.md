- Semantic HTML5 markup

## Useful resources

- [CSS BEM - dpw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rltjnLyjFZk&t=818s) - this helped me build a cleaner and more standardized CSS.
- [featch api - Matheus Battisti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIGYM4S8x50&t=940s) - this helped me understand how _then_ and api consumption work.
